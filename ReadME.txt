This Course is found on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzwzrDvZ18&t=20225s

Purely educational, trying to hone my own skills on these topics

I want to store each lesson to track me learning.

I know that I am advanced at the beginning of the Course
but I want to get some refresher before starting my
Backend development journey.
